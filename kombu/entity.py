    .. attribute:: name

        Name of the exchange. Default is no name (the default exchange).

    .. attribute:: type

        AMQP defines four default exchange types (routing algorithms) that
        covers most of the common messaging use cases. An AMQP broker can
        also define additional exchange types, so see your broker
        manual for more information about available exchange types.

            * `direct` (*default*)

                Direct match between the routing key in the message, and the
                routing criteria used when a queue is bound to this exchange.

            * `topic`

                Wildcard match between the routing key and the routing pattern
                specified in the exchange/queue binding. The routing key is
                treated as zero or more words delimited by `"."` and
                supports special wildcard characters. `"*"` matches a
                single word and `"#"` matches zero or more words.

            * `fanout`

                Queues are bound to this exchange with no arguments. Hence any
                message sent to this exchange will be forwarded to all queues
                bound to this exchange.

            * `headers`

                Queues are bound to this exchange with a table of arguments
                containing headers and values (optional). A special argument
                named "x-match" determines the matching algorithm, where
                `"all"` implies an `AND` (all pairs must match) and
                `"any"` implies `OR` (at least one pair must match).

                :attr:`arguments` is used to specify the arguments.

            This description of AMQP exchange types was shamelessly stolen
            from the blog post `AMQP in 10 minutes: Part 4`_ by
            Rajith Attapattu. This article is recommended reading.

    .. attribute:: channel

        The channel the exchange is bound to (if bound).

    .. attribute:: durable

        Durable exchanges remain active when a server restarts. Non-durable
        exchanges (transient exchanges) are purged when a server restarts.
        Default is :const:`True`.

    .. attribute:: auto_delete

        If set, the exchange is deleted when all queues have finished
        using it. Default is :const:`False`.

    .. attribute:: delivery_mode

        The default delivery mode used for messages. The value is an integer,
        or alias string.

            * 1 or `"transient"`

                The message is transient. Which means it is stored in
                memory only, and is lost if the server dies or restarts.

            * 2 or "persistent" (*default*)
                The message is persistent. Which means the message is
                stored both in-memory, and on disk, and therefore
                preserved if the server dies or restarts.

        The default value is 2 (persistent).

    .. attribute:: name

        Name of the queue. Default is no name (default queue destination).

    .. attribute:: exchange

        The :class:`Exchange` the queue binds to.

    .. attribute:: routing_key

        The routing key (if any), also called *binding key*.

        The interpretation of the routing key depends on
        the :attr:`Exchange.type`.

            * direct exchange

                Matches if the routing key property of the message and
                the :attr:`routing_key` attribute are identical.

            * fanout exchange

                Always matches, even if the binding does not have a key.

            * topic exchange

                Matches the routing key property of the message by a primitive
                pattern matching scheme. The message routing key then consists
                of words separated by dots (`"."`, like domain names), and
                two special characters are available; star (`"*"`) and hash
                (`"#"`). The star matches any word, and the hash matches
                zero or more words. For example `"*.stock.#"` matches the
                routing keys `"usd.stock"` and `"eur.stock.db"` but not
                `"stock.nasdaq"`.

    .. attribute:: channel

        The channel the Queue is bound to (if bound).

    .. attribute:: durable

        Durable queues remain active when a server restarts.
        Non-durable queues (transient queues) are purged if/when
        a server restarts.
        Note that durable queues do not necessarily hold persistent
        messages, although it does not make sense to send
        persistent messages to a transient queue.

        Default is :const:`True`.

    .. attribute:: exclusive

        Exclusive queues may only be consumed from by the
        current connection. Setting the 'exclusive' flag
        always implies 'auto-delete'.

        Default is :const:`False`.

    .. attribute:: auto_delete

        If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have
        finished using it. Last consumer can be cancelled
        either explicitly or because its channel is closed. If
        there was no consumer ever on the queue, it won't be
        deleted.

    .. attribute:: queue_arguments

        Additional arguments used when declaring the queue.

    .. attribute:: binding_arguments

        Additional arguments used when binding the queue.

    .. attribute:: alias

        Unused in Kombu, but applications can take advantage of this.
        For example to give alternate names to queues with automatically
        generated queue names.
