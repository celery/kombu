class Channel(base.StdChannel):
    """Supports broker configuration and messaging send and receive.

    A Channel object is designed to have method-parity with a Channel as
    defined in AMQP 0-10 and earlier, which allows for the following broker
    actions:

        - exchange declare and delete
        - queue declare and delete
        - queue bind and unbind operations
        - queue length and purge operations
        - sending/receiving/rejecting messages
        - structuring, encoding, and decoding messages
        - supports synchronous and asynchronous reads
        - reading state about the exchange, queues, and bindings

    Channels are designed to all share a single TCP connection with a
    broker, but provide a level of isolated communication with the broker
    while benefiting from a shared TCP connection.  The Channel is given
    its :class:`Connection` object by the :class:`Transport` that
    instantiates the Channel.

    This Channel inherits from :class:`~kombu.transport.base.StdChannel`,
    which makes this a 'native' Channel versus a 'virtual' Channel which
    would inherit from :class:`kombu.transports.virtual`.

    Messages sent using this Channel are assigned a delivery_tag. The
    delivery_tag is generated for a message as they are prepared for
    sending by :meth:`basic_publish`.  The delivery_tag is unique per
    Channel instance using :meth:`~itertools.count`.  The delivery_tag has
    no meaningful context in other objects, and is only maintained in the
    memory of this object, and the underlying objects that provide support
    (ie: :class:`QoS`).

    Each Channel object instantiates exactly one :class:`QoS` object for
    prefetch limiting, and asynchronous acking. The :class:`QoS` object is
    lazily instantiated through a property method :meth:`qos`.  The
    :class:`QoS` object is a supporting object that should not be accessed
    directly except by the Channel itself.

    Synchronous reads on a queue are done using a call to :meth:`basic_get`
    which uses :meth:`_get` to perform the reading. These methods read
    immediately and do not accept some form of timeout. :meth:`basic_get`
    reads synchronously and ACKs messages before returning them, or acking
    can be disable by the no_ack argument to :meth:`basic_get`.

    Asynchronous reads on a queue are done by starting a consumer using
    :meth:`basic_consume`.  Each call to :meth:`basic_consume` will cause a
    thread to be started where a :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Receiver`
    will perform a blocking read on the requested queue. Typically a more
    efficient external I/O event notification system such as epoll or
    kqueue would allow the kernel to monitor many file descriptors for
    inbound data, but the :mod:`qpid.messaging` module does not allow an
    external epoll or kqueue loop to be used. Consumers are given a
    consumer tag by the caller of consumer_tag. Already started consumers
    can be cancelled using by their consumer_tag using :meth:`basic_cancel`.

    The Channel object handles thread creation of :class:`FDShimThread`
    objects which provide asynchronous blocking reads.  FDShimThreads are
    given a :class:`Queue.Queue` object to put messages into called
    delivery_queue. delivery_queue is provided by the creator of the
    Channel (typically a :class:`Transport` object).  Cancellation of a
    consumer causes the consuming class:`FDShimThread` to be notified it is
    no longer needed.

    Asynchronous message acking is supported through :meth:`basic_ack`,
    and is referenced by delivery_tag. The Channel object uses its
    :class:`QoS` object to perform the message acking.

    :param connection: A Connection object that this Channel can reference.
        Currently only used to access callbacks.
    :type connection: Connection
    :param transport: The Transport this Channel is associated with.

        This method starts a consumer the reads messages from a queue

        Once a message is read, a call to the callback will occur with the
        message as the single argument.  The message passed to the callback
        is of type self.Message.  Each consumer is referenced by a
        consumer_tag, which is provided by the caller of this method.

        Consuming is done using a thread of type :class:`FDShimThread` that
        is spawned when this method is called.  The child thread is marked as
        a daemon, indicating that if all non-daemon threads exit, the child
        consumer thread will also exit.  The child consumer thread performs
        an efficient blocking read, which wakes up regularly to see if it
        should exit.

        The child consumer thread does not call the callback directly.
        Instead, the child thread is given a threadsafe :class:`Queue.Queue`
        object which it should deliver messages into.  This single queue
        aggregates all consumer messages, can be read through a call to
        :meth:`~Transport.drain_events` on the Transport object associated
        with this Channel object.  This method sets up the callback onto the
        self.connection object in a dict keyed by queue name.
        :meth:`~Transport.drain_events` is responsible for calling that
        callback upon message receipt.

        Depending on the value of the no_ack parameter, the message that is
        received can be saved for asynchronous acking later after the
        message has been handled by the caller of
        :meth:`~Transport.drain_events`. Messages can be acked after being
        received through a call to :meth:`basic_ack`. If no_ack is True,
        then messages are not saved for acking later. If no_ack is False,
        then messages are saved for acking later. Internally the :class:`QoS`
        object is used to store messages for acking later.

        :meth:`basic_consume` transforms the message object type prior to
        calling the callback.  Initially the message comes in as a
        :class:`qpid.messaging.Message`.  This method unpacks the payload
        of the :class:`qpid.messaging.Message` and creates a new object of
        type self.Message.

        This method wraps the user delivered callback in a runtime-built
        function which provides the type transformation from
        :class:`qpid.messaging.Message` to

    An instance of FDShimThread will asynchronously read messages from a
    single queue, and deliver each message read into a threadsafe
    :class:`Queue.Queue` object delivery_queue.  The broker queue to read
    from is specified by name.  A separate thread of type :class:`FDShim` is
    designed to receive and handle messages that FDShimThread object put
    into the delivery_queue.

    FDShimThread objects are designed to be efficient through a blocking
    read from the broker's queue.  Periodically the FDShimThread wakes up
    from the blocking read, and checks to see if it has been killed.  If it
    has not been killed it begins a new blocking read.  The blocking
    timeout is set through the class attribute block_timeout that contains
    the timeout in seconds.

    FDShimThread requires a function to be passed in that will allow the
    FDShimThread to generate a connection to the broker.  FDShimThread uses
    the passed in function to get the connection, start a session with the
    broker, and create a :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Receiver` to
    consume messages from the named queue.

    An FDShimThread instance can be notified that it should die with a call
    to :meth:`kill`.  The thread may not exit immediately because it may
    be in a blocking read, but it will exit before entering the next
    blocking read.  When the thread exits properly, it gracefully closes the
    _receiver and _session objects that were created.

    other than :class:`Channel`.  An FDShimThread is created by a call to
    :meth:`Channel.basic_consume`, and destroyed through a call to
    :meth:`Channel.basic_cancel`.  The thread entry point is the :meth:`run`
    method. :meth:`Channel.basic_consume` daemonizes the thread before

        """Handle any read events associated with this Transport.

        This method clears a single message from the externally monitored
        file descriptor by issuing a read call to the self.fd_shim pipe,
        which removes a single '0' character that was placed into the pipe
        by :class:`FDShim`. Once a '0' is read, all available events are
        drained through a call to :meth:`drain_events`.

        Nothing is expected to be returned from :meth:`drain_events` because
        :meth:`drain_events` handles messages by calling callbacks that are
        maintained on the :class:`Connection` object.  When
        :meth:`drain_events` returns, all associated messages have been
        handled.

        This method reads as many messages that are available for this
        Transport, and then returns.  It blocks in the sense that reading
        and handling a large number of messages may take time, but it does
        not block waiting for a new message to arrive.  When
        :meth:`drain_events` is called a timeout is not specified, which
        causes this behavior.

        One interesting behavior of note is where multiple messages are
        ready, and this method removes a single '0' character from
        fd_shim.r, but :meth:`drain_events` may handle an arbitrary amount of
        messages.  In that case, extra '0' characters may be left on fd_shim
        to be read, where messages corresponding with those '0' characters
        have already been handled.  The external epoll loop will incorrectly
        think additional data is ready for reading, and will call
        on_readable unnecessarily, once for each '0' to be read. Additional
        calls to :meth:`on_readable` produce no negative side effects,
        and will eventually clear out the fd_shim pipe of all symbols
        correctly.  If new messages show up during this draining period,
        they will also be properly handled.

            events, which contains the callbacks that need to be called for
            the readables.
