Important Notes
===============

.. _v200-python-compatibility:

Python Compatibility
--------------------

* No longer supports Python 2.4.

    Users of Python 2.4 can still use the 1.x series.

    The 1.x series has entered bugfix-only maintenance mode, and will
    stay that way as long as there is demand, and a willingness to
    maintain it.


.. _v200-new-transports:

New Transports
--------------

* ``django-kombu`` is now part of Kombu core.

    The Django message transport uses the Django ORM to store messages.

    It uses polling, with a default polling interval of 5 seconds.
    The polling interval can be increased or decreased by configuring the
    ``KOMBU_POLLING_INTERVAL`` Django setting, which is the polling
    interval in seconds as an int or a float.  Note that shorter polling
    intervals can cause extreme strain on the database: if responsiveness
    is needed you shall consider switching to a non-polling transport.

    To use it you must use transport alias ``"django"``,
    or as an URL::

        django://

    and then add ``kombu.transport.django`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and
    run ``manage.py syncdb`` to create the necessary database tables.

    **Upgrading**

    If you have previously used ``django-kombu``, then the entry
    in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` must be changed from ``djkombu``
    to ``kombu.transport.django``::

        INSTALLED_APPS = (…,
                          "kombu.transport.django")

    If you have previously used django-kombu, then there is no need
    to recreate the tables, as the old tables will be fully compatible
    with the new version.

* ``kombu-sqlalchemy`` is now part of Kombu core.

    This change requires no code changes given that the
    ``sqlalchemy`` transport alias is used.

.. _v200-news:

News
----

* :class:`kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin` is a mixin class that lets you
  easily write consumer programs and threads.

  See :ref:`examples` and :ref:`guide-consumers`.

* SQS Transport: Added support for SQS queue prefixes (Issue #84).

    The queue prefix can be set using the transport option
    ``queue_name_prefix``::

        BrokerTransport("SQS://", transport_options={
            "queue_name_prefix": "myapp"})

    Contributed by Nitzan Miron.

* ``Producer.publish`` now supports automatic retry.

    Retry is enabled by the ``reply`` argument, and retry options
    set by the ``retry_policy`` argument::

        exchange = Exchange("foo")
        producer.publish(message, exchange=exchange, retry=True,
                         declare=[exchange], retry_policy={
                            "interval_start": 1.0})

    See :meth:`~kombu.connection.BrokerConnection.ensure`
    for a list of supported retry policy options.

* ``Producer.publish`` now supports a ``declare`` keyword argument.

    This is a list of entities (:class:`Exchange`, or :class:`Queue`)
    that should be declared before the message is published.

.. _v200-fixes:

Fixes
-----

* Redis transport: Timeout was multiplied by 1000 seconds when using
  ``select`` for event I/O (Issue #86).

.. _version-1.5.1:

1.5.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-11-30 01:00 P.M GMT
:by: Ask Solem

* Fixes issue with ``kombu.compat`` introduced in 1.5.0 (Issue #83).

* Adds the ability to disable content_types in the serializer registry.

    Any message with a content type that is disabled will be refused.
    One example would be to disable the Pickle serializer:

        >>> from kombu.serialization import registry
        # by name
        >>> registry.disable("pickle")
        # or by mime-type.
        >>> registry.disable("application/x-python-serialize")

.. _version-1.5.0:

1.5.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-11-27 06:00 P.M GMT
:by: Ask Solem

* kombu.pools: Fixed a bug resulting in resources not being properly released.

  This was caused by the use of ``__hash__`` to distinguish them.

* Virtual transports: Dead-letter queue is now disabled by default.

    The dead-letter queue was enabled by default to help application
    authors, but now that Kombu is stable it should be removed.
    There are after all many cases where messages should just be dropped
    when there are no queues to buffer them, and keeping them without
    supporting automatic cleanup is rather considered a resource leak
    than a feature.

    If wanted the dead-letter queue can still be enabled, by using
    the ``deadletter_queue`` transport option::

        >>> x = BrokerConnection("redis://",
        ...       transport_options={"deadletter_queue": "ae.undeliver"})

    In addition, an :class:`UndeliverableWarning` is now emitted when
    the dead-letter queue is enabled and a message ends up there.

    Contributed by Ionel Maries Cristian.

* MongoDB transport now supports Replicasets (Issue #81).

    Contributed by Ivan Metzlar.

* The ``Connection.ensure`` methods now accepts a ``max_retries`` value
  of 0.

    A value of 0 now means *do not retry*, which is distinct from :const:`None`
    which means *retry indefinitely*.

    Contributed by Dan McGee.

* SQS Transport: Now has a lowercase ``sqs`` alias, so that it can be
  used with broker URLs (Issue #82).

    Fix contributed by Hong Minhee

* SQS Transport: Fixes KeyError on message acknowledgements (Issue #73).

    The SQS transport now uses UUID's for delivery tags, rather than
    a counter.

    Fix contributed by Brian Bernstein.

* SQS Transport: Unicode related fixes (Issue #82).

    Fix contributed by Hong Minhee.

* Redis version check could crash because of improper handling of types
  (Issue #63).

* Fixed error with `Resource.force_close_all` when resources
  were not yet properly initialized (Issue #78).

.. _version-1.4.3:

1.4.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-27 10:00 P.M BST

* Fixes bug in ProducerPool where too many resources would be acquired.

.. _version-1.4.2:

1.4.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-26 05:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Eventio: Polling should ignore `errno.EINTR`

* SQS: str.encode did only start accepting kwargs after Py2.7.

* simple_task_queue example didn't run correctly (Issue #72).

    Fix contributed by Stefan Eletzhofer.

* Empty messages would not raise an exception not able to be handled
  by `on_decode_error` (Issue #72)

    Fix contributed by Christophe Chauvet.

* CouchDB: Properly authenticate if user/password set (Issue #70)

    Fix contributed by Rafael Duran Castaneda

* BrokerConnection.Consumer had the wrong signature.

    Fix contributed by Pavel Skvazh

.. _version-1.4.1:

1.4.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-26 04:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* 1.4.0 broke the producer pool, resulting in new connections being
  established for every acquire.


.. _version-1.4.0:

1.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-22 05:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Adds module :mod:`kombu.mixins`.

    This module contains a :class:`~kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin` class
    that can be used to easily implement a message consumer
    thread that consumes messages from one or more
    :class:`kombu.messaging.Consumer` instances.

* New example: :ref:`task-queue-example`

    Using the ``ConsumerMixin``, default channels and
    the global connection pool to demonstrate new Kombu features.

* MongoDB transport did not work with MongoDB >= 2.0 (Issue #66)

    Fix contributed by James Turk.

* Redis-py version check did not account for beta identifiers
  in version string.

    Fix contributed by David Ziegler.

* Producer and Consumer now accepts a connection instance as the
  first argument.

    The connections default channel will then be used.

    In addition shortcut methods has been added to BrokerConnection::

        >>> connection.Producer(exchange)
        >>> connection.Consumer(queues=..., callbacks=...)

* BrokerConnection has aquired a ``connected`` attribute that
  can be used to check if the connection instance has established
  a connection.

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire_channel`` now returns the connections
  default channel rather than establising a new channel that
  must be manually handled.

* Added ``kombu.common.maybe_declare``

    ``maybe_declare(entity)`` declares an entity if it has
    not previously been declared in the same process.

* :func:`kombu.compat.entry_to_queue` has been moved to :mod:`kombu.common`

* New module :mod:`kombu.clocks` now contains an implementation
  of Lamports logical clock.

.. _version-1.3.5:

1.3.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-16 06:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Python 3: AMQP_PROTOCOL_HEADER must be bytes, not str.

.. _version-1.3.4:

1.3.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-16 06:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* Fixes syntax error in pools.reset


.. _version-1.3.3:

1.3.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-15 02:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

* pools.reset did not support after forker arguments.

.. _version-1.3.2:

1.3.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-10 01:00 P.M BST
:by: Mher Movsisyan

* Broke Python 2.5 compatibility by importing ``parse_qsl`` from ``urlparse``

* Connection.default_channel is now closed when connection is revived
  after connection failures.

* Pika: Channel now supports the ``connection.client`` attribute
  as required by the simple interface.

* pools.set_limit now raises an exception if the limit is lower
  than the previous limit.

* pools.set_limit no longer resets the pools.

.. _version-1.3.1:

1.3.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-07 03:00 P.M BST

* Last release broke after fork for pool reinitialization.

* Producer/Consumer now has a ``connection`` attribute,
  giving access to the :class:`BrokerConnection` of the
  instance.

* Pika: Channels now have access to the underlying
  :class:`BrokerConnection` instance using ``channel.connection.client``.

    This was previously required by the ``Simple`` classes and is now
    also required by :class:`Consumer` and :class:`Producer`.

* Connection.default_channel is now closed at object revival.

* Adds kombu.clocks.LamportClock.

* compat.entry_to_queue has been moved to new module :mod:`kombu.common`.

.. _version-1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-05 01:00 P.M BST

* Broker connection info can be now be specified using URLs

    The broker hostname can now be given as an URL instead, of the format::

        transport://user:password@hostname:port/virtual_host

    for example the default broker is expressed as::

        >>> BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//")

    Transport defaults to amqp, and is not required.
    user, password, port and virtual_host is also not mandatory and
    will default to the corresponding transports default.

    .. note::

        Note that the path component (virtual_host) always starts with a
        forward-slash.  This is necessary to distinguish between the virtual
        host '' (empty) and '/', which are both acceptable virtual host names.

        A virtual host of '/' becomes:

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

        and a virtual host of '' (empty) becomes::

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/

        So the leading slash in the path component is **always required**.

* Now comes with default global connection and producer pools.

    The acquire a connection using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`BrokerConnection`::

        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection, connections
        >>> connection = BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost//")
        >>> with connections[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     # do something with connection

    To acquire a producer using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`BrokerConnection`::

        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection, producers
        >>> connection = BrokerConnection("amqp://guest:guest@localhost//")
        >>> with producers[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     producer.publish({"hello": "world"}, exchange="hello")

    Acquiring a producer will in turn also acquire a connection
    from the associated pool in ``connections``, so you the number
    of producers is bound the same limit as number of connections.

    The default limit of 100 connections per connection instance
    can be changed by doing::

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pools.set_limit(10)

    The pool can also be forcefully closed by doing::

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pool.reset()

* SQS Transport: Persistence using SimpleDB is now disabled by default,
  after reports of unstable SimpleDB connections leading to errors.

* :class:`Producer` can now be used as a context manager.

* ``Producer.__exit__`` now properly calls ``release`` instead of close.

    The previous behavior would lead to a memory leak when using
    the :class:`kombu.pools.ProducerPool`

* Now silences all exceptions from `import ctypes` to match behaviour
  of the standard Python uuid module, and avoid passing on MemoryError
  exceptions on SELinux-enabled systems (Issue #52 + Issue #53)

* ``amqp`` is now an alias to the ``amqplib`` transport.

* ``kombu.syn.detect_environment`` now returns 'default', 'eventlet', or
  'gevent' depending on what monkey patches have been installed.

* Serialization registry has new attribute ``type_to_name`` so it is
  possible to lookup serializater name by content type.

* Exchange argument to ``Producer.publish`` can now be an :class:`Exchange`
  instance.

* ``compat.Publisher`` now supports the ``channel`` keyword argument.

* Acking a message on some transports could lead to :exc:`KeyError` being
  raised (Issue #57).

* Connection pool:  Connections are no long instantiated when the pool is
  created, but instantiated as needed instead.

* Tests now pass on PyPy.

* ``Connection.as_uri`` now includes the password if the keyword argument
  ``include_password`` is set.

* Virtual transports now comes with a default ``default_connection_params``
  attribute.

.. _version-1.2.1:

1.2.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-07-29 12:52 P.M BST

* Now depends on amqplib >= 1.0.0.

* Redis: Now automatically deletes auto_delete queues at ``basic_cancel``.

* ``serialization.unregister`` added so it is possible to remove unwanted
  seralizers.

* Fixes MemoryError while importing ctypes on SELinux (Issue #52).

* ``BrokerConnection.autoretry`` is a version of ``ensure`` that works
  with arbitrary functions (i.e. it does not need an associated object
  that implements the ``revive`` method.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: python

        channel = connection.channel()
        try:
            ret, channel = connection.autoretry(send_messages, channel=channel)
        finally:
            channel.close()

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire`` no longer force establishes the connection.

    The connection will be established as needed.

* ``BrokerConnection.ensure`` now supports an ``on_revive`` callback
  that is applied whenever the connection is re-established.

* ``Consumer.consuming_from(queue)`` returns True if the Consumer is
  consuming from ``queue``.

* ``Consumer.cancel_by_queue`` did not remove the queue from ``queues``.

* ``compat.ConsumerSet.add_queue_from_dict`` now automatically declared
  the queue if ``auto_declare`` set.

.. _version-1.2.0:

1.2.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-07-15 12:00 P.M BST

* Virtual: Fixes cyclic reference in Channel.close (Issue #49).

* Producer.publish: Can now set additional properties using keyword
  arguments (Issue #48).

* Adds Queue.no_ack option to control the no_ack option for individual queues.

* Recent versions broke pylibrabbitmq support.

* SimpleQueue and SimpleBuffer can now be used as contexts.

* Test requirements specifies PyYAML==3.09 as 3.10 dropped Python 2.4 support

* Now properly reports default values in Connection.info/.as_uri

.. _version-1.1.6:

1.1.6
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-13 04:00 P.M BST

* Redis: Fixes issue introduced in 1.1.4, where a redis connection
  failure could leave consumer hanging forever.

* SQS: Now supports fanout messaging by using SimpleDB to store routing
  tables.

    This can be disabled by setting the `supports_fanout` transport option:

        >>> BrokerConnection(transport="SQS",
        ...                  transport_options={"supports_fanout": False})

* SQS: Now properly deletes a message when a message is acked.

* SQS: Can now set the Amazon AWS region, by using the ``region``
  transport option.

* amqplib: Now uses `localhost` as default hostname instead of raising an
  error.

.. _version-1.1.5:

1.1.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-07 06:00 P.M BST

* Fixes compatibility with redis-py 2.4.4.

.. _version-1.1.4:

1.1.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-06-07 04:00 P.M BST

* Redis transport: Now requires redis-py version 2.4.4 or later.

* New Amazon SQS transport added.

    Usage:

        >>> conn = BrokerConnection(transport="SQS",
        ...                         userid=aws_access_key_id,
        ...                         password=aws_secret_access_key)

    The environment variables :envvar:`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
    :envvar:`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are also supported.

* librabbitmq transport: Fixes default credentials support.

* amqplib transport: Now supports `login_method` for SSL auth.

    :class:`BrokerConnection` now supports the `login_method`
    keyword argument.

    Default `login_method` is ``AMQPLAIN``.

.. _version-1.1.3:

1.1.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-21 16:00 P.M CEST

* Redis: Consuming from multiple connections now works with Eventlet.

* Redis: Can now perform channel operations while the channel is in
  BRPOP/LISTEN mode (Issue #35).

    Also the async BRPOP now times out after 1 second, this means that
    cancelling consuming from a queue/starting consuming from additional queues
    has a latency of up to one second (BRPOP does not support subsecond
    timeouts).

* Virtual: Allow channel objects to be closed multiple times without error.

* amqplib: ``AttributeError`` has been added to the list of known
  connection related errors (:attr:`Connection.connection_errors`).

* amqplib: Now converts :exc:`SSLError` timeout errors to
  :exc:`socket.timeout` (http://bugs.python.org/issue10272)

* Ensures cyclic references are destroyed when the connection is closed.

.. _version-1.1.2:

1.1.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-06 16:00 P.M CEST

* Redis: Fixes serious issue where messages could be lost.

    The issue could happen if the message exceeded a certain number
    of kilobytes in size.

    It is recommended that all users of the Redis transport should
    upgrade to this version, even if not currently experiencing any
    issues.

.. _version-1.1.1:

1.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-05 15:51 P.M CEST

* 1.1.0 started using ``Queue.LifoQueue`` which is only available
  in Python 2.6+ (Issue #33).  We now ship with our own LifoQueue.


.. _version-1.1.0:

1.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-04-05 01:05 P.M CEST

.. _v110-important:

Important Notes
---------------

* Virtual transports: Message body is now base64 encoded by default
  (Issue #27).

    This should solve problems sending binary data with virtual
    transports.

    Message compatibility is handled by adding a ``body_encoding``
    property, so messages sent by older versions is compatible
    with this release.  However -- If you are accessing the messages
    directly not using Kombu, then you have to respect
    the ``body_encoding`` property.

    If you need to disable base64 encoding then you can do so
    via the transport options::

        BrokerConnection(transport="...",
                         transport_options={"body_encoding": None})

    **For transport authors**:

        You don't have to change anything in your custom transports,
        as this is handled automatically by the base class.

        If you want to use a different encoder you can do so by adding
        a key to ``Channel.codecs``.  Default encoding is specified
        by the ``Channel.body_encoding`` attribute.

        A new codec must provide two methods: ``encode(data)`` and
        ``decode(data)``.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Setting ``limit=None`` (or 0)
  now disables pool semantics, and will establish and close
  the resource whenever acquired or released.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Is now using a LIFO queue
  instead of the previous FIFO behavior.

    This means that the last resource released will be the one
    acquired next.  I.e. if only a single thread is using the pool
    this means only a single connection will ever be used.

* BrokerConnection: Cloned connections did not inherit transport_options
  (``__copy__``).

* contrib/requirements is now located in the top directory
  of the distribution.

* MongoDB: Now supports authentication using the ``userid`` and ``password``
  arguments to :class:`BrokerConnection` (Issue #30).

* BrokerConnection: Default autentication credentials are now delegated to
  the individual transports.
 
    This means that the ``userid`` and ``password`` arguments to
    BrokerConnection is no longer *guest/guest* by default.

    The amqplib and pika transports will still have the default
    credentials.

* :meth:`Consumer.__exit__` did not have the correct signature (Issue #32).

* Channel objects now have a ``channel_id`` attribute.

* MongoDB: Version sniffing broke with development versions of
	mongod (Issue #29).

* New environment variable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION` will now emit debug
  log messages for connection related actions.

  :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` will also enable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION`.

.. _version-1.0.7:

1.0.7
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-28 05:45 P.M CEST

* Now depends on anyjson 0.3.1

    cjson is no longer a recommended json implementation, and anyjson
    will now emit a deprecation warning if used.

* Please note that the Pika backend only works with version 0.5.2.

    The latest version (0.9.x) drastically changed API, and it is not
    compatible yet.

* on_decode_error is now called for exceptions in message_to_python
  (Issue #24).

* Redis: did not respect QoS settings.

* Redis: Creating a connection now ensures the connection is established.

    This means ``BrokerConnection.ensure_connection`` works properly with
    Redis.

* consumer_tag argument to ``Queue.consume`` can't be :const:`None`
  (Issue #21).

    A None value is now automatically converted to empty string.
    An empty string will make the server generate a unique tag.

* BrokerConnection now supports a ``transport_options`` argument.

    This can be used to pass additional arguments to transports.

* Pika: ``drain_events`` raised :exc:`socket.timeout` even if no timeout
  set (Issue #8).

.. version-1.0.6:

1.0.6
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-22 04:00 P.M CET

* The ``delivery_mode`` aliases (persistent/transient) were not automatically
  converted to integer, and would cause a crash if using the amqplib
  transport.

* Redis: The redis-py :exc:`InvalidData` exception suddenly changed name to
  :exc:`DataError`.

* The :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` environment variable can now be set to log all
  channel method calls.

  Support for the following environment variables have been added:

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CHANNEL` will wrap channels in an object that
      logs every method call.

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` both enables channel logging and configures the
      root logger to emit messages to standard error.

    **Example Usage**::

        $ KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG=1 python
        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection
        >>> conn = BrokerConnection()
        >>> channel = conn.channel()
        Start from server, version: 8.0, properties:
            {u'product': 'RabbitMQ',..............  }
        Open OK! known_hosts []
        using channel_id: 1
        Channel open
        >>> channel.queue_declare("myq", passive=True)
        [Kombu channel:1] queue_declare('myq', passive=True)
        (u'myq', 0, 1)

.. _version-1.0.5:

1.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-17 04:00 P.M CET

* Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels.  All virtual transports
  affected (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy, couchdb, beanstalk).

* Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking messages.

    If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself as an
    exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation. (``object no longer
    exists``).

* MongoDB transport requires the ``findandmodify`` command only available in
  MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if connected to an incompatible
  server version.

* Virtual Transports: ``basic.cancel`` should not try to remove unknown
  consumer tag.
