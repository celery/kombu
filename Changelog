1.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-05 16:00 P.M CET

* Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels.  All virtual transports
  affects (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy, couchdb, beanstalk).

* Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking messages.

    If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself as an
    exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation. (``object no longer
    exists``).

* MongoDB transport requires the ``findandmodify`` command only available in
  MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if connected to an incompatible
  server version.

* Virtual Transports: ``basic.cancel`` should not try to remove unknown
  consumer tag.
