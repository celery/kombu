.. _version-4.0:

4.0
===
:release-date: TBA

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 2.0.0.

- No longer depends on :mod:`anyjson`.

- New SQS transport

    Donated by NextDoor, with additional contributions from mdk.

- Redis: Priority 0 is now lowest, 9 is highest.
  (**backward incompatible**)

    This to match how priorities in AMQP works.

    Fix contributed by **Alex Koshelev**.

- RabbitMQ Queue Extensions

    New arguments have been added to :class:`kombu.Queue` that lets
    you directly and conveniently configure the RabbitMQ queue extensions.

    - ``Queue(expires=20.0)``

        Set queue expiry time in float seconds.

        See :attr:`kombu.Queue.expires`.

    - ``Queue(message_ttl=30.0)``

        Set queue message time-to-live float seconds.

        See :attr:`kombu.Queue.message_ttl`.

    - ``Queue(max_length=1000)``

        Set queue max length (number of messages) as int.

        See :attr:`kombu.Queue.max_length`.

    - ``Queue(max_length_bytes=1000)``

        Set queue max length (message size total in bytes) as int.

        See :attr:`kombu.Queue.max_length_bytes`.

    - ``Queue(max_priority=10)``

        Declare queue to be a priority queue that routes messages
        based on the ``priority` field of the message.

        See :attr:`kombu.Queue.max_priority`.

- Beanstalk: Priority 0 is now lowest, 9 is highest.
  (**backward incompatible**)

    This to match how priorities in AMQP works.

    Fix contributed by **Alex Koshelev**.

- Redis: now supports SSL using the ``ssl`` argument to
  :class:`~kombu.Connection`.

- Redis: Fanout exchanges are no longer visible between vhosts,
  and fanout messages can be filtered by patterns.
  (**backward incompatible**)

    It was possible to enable this mode previously using the
    ``fanout_prefix``, and ``fanout_patterns``
    transport options, but now these are enabled by default.

    If you want to mix and match producers/consumers running different
    versions you need to configure your kombu 3.x clients to also enable
    these options:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> Connection(transport_options={
            'fanout_prefix': True,
            'fanout_patterns': True,
        })

- Pidbox: Mailbox new arguments: TTL and expiry.

    Mailbox now supports new arguments for controlling
    message TTLs and queue expiry, both for the mailbox
    queue and for reply queues.

    - ``queue_expires`` (float/int seconds).
    - ``queue_ttl`` (float/int seconds).
    - ``reply_queue_expires`` (float/int seconds).
    - ``reply_queue_ttl`` (float/int seconds).

    Contributed by **Alan Justino**.

All take seconds in int/float.

- Exchange.delivery_mode now defaults to :const:`None`, and the default
  is instead set by ``Producer.publish``.

- :class:`~kombu.Consumer` now supports a new ``prefetch_count`` argument,
  which if provided will force the consumer to set an initial prefetch count
  just before starting.

- Virtual transports now stores ``priority`` as a property, not in
  ``delivery_info``, to be compatible with AMQP.

- ``reply_to`` argument to ``Producer.publish`` can now be
  :class:`~kombu.Queue` instance.

- Connection: There's now a new method
  ``Connection.supports_exchange_type(type)`` that can be used to check if the
  current transport supports a specific exchange type.

- SQS: Consumers can now read json messages not sent by Kombu.

    Contributed by **Juan Carlos Ferrer**.

- SQS: Will now log the access key used when authentication fails.

    Contributed by **Hank John**.

- Added new :class:`kombu.mixins.ConsumerProducerMixin` for consumers that
  will also publish messages on a separate connection.

- Messages: Now have a more descriptive ``repr``.

    Contributed by **Joshua Harlow**.

- Async: HTTP client based on curl.

- Async: Now uses `poll` instead of `select` where available.

- MongoDB: Now supports priorities

    Contributed by **Alex Koshelev**.

- Zookeeper: Transport now uses the built-in suport in kazoo to handle
  failover when using a list of server names.

    Contributed by **Joshua Harlow**.

- Removed module ``kombu.syn``

    ``detect_environment`` has been moved to kombu.utils.compat

.. admonition:: Django transport migrations.

    If you're using Django 1.8 and have already created the

        $ python manage.py migrate kombu_transport_django --fake-initial

- No longer compatible with South by default.

    To keep using kombu.transport.django with South migrations
    you now need to configure a new location for the kombu migrations:

    .. code-block:: python

        SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES = {
            'kombu_transport_django':
                'kombu.transport.django.south_migrations',
        }

- Keep old South migrations in ``kombu.transport.django.south_migrations``.

======
:release-date: 2014-04-15 09:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.5.

- RabbitMQ 3.3 changes QoS semantics (Issue #339).

    See the RabbitMQ release notes here:
    http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2014/04/02/breaking-things-with-rabbitmq-3-3/

    A new connection property has been added that can be used to detect
    whether the remote server is using this new QoS behavior:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> Connection('amqp://').qos_behavior_matches_spec
        False

    so if your application depends on the old semantics you can
    use this to set the ``apply_global`` flag appropriately:

    .. code-block:: python

        def update_prefetch_count(channel, new_value):
            channel.basic_qos(
                0, new_value,
                not channel.connection.client.qos_behavior_matches_spec,
            )

- Users of :mod:`librabbitmq` is encouraged to upgrade to librabbitmq 1.5.0.

    The ``kombu[librabbitmq]`` extra has been updated to depend on this
    version.

- Pools: Now takes transport options into account when comparing connections
  (Issue #333).

- MongoDB: Fixes Python 3 compatibility.

- Async: select: Ignore socket errors when attempting to unregister handles
  from the loop.

- Pidbox: Can now be configured to use a serializer other than json,
  but specifying a serializer argument to :class:`~kombu.pidbox.Mailbox`.

    Contributed by Dmitry Malinovsky.

- Message decompression now works with Python 3.

    Fix contributed by Adam Gaca.

.. _version-3.0.14:

3.0.14
======
:release-date: 2014-03-19 07:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- **MongoDB**: Now endures a connection failover (Issue #123).

    Fix contributed by Alex Koshelev.

  connection (Issue #320).

.. _version-3.0.13:

3.0.13
======
:release-date: 2014-03-03 04:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Redis: Fixed serious race condition that could lead to data loss.

    The delivery tags were accidentally set to be an incremental number
    local to the channel, but the delivery tags need to be globally
    unique so that a message can not overwrite an older message
    in the backup store.

    This change is not backwards incompatible and you are encouraged
    to update all your system using a previous version as soon as possible.

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.4.

- Pidbox: Now makes sure message encoding errors are handled by default,
  so that a custom error handler does not need to be specified.

- Redis: The fanout exchange can now use AMQP patterns to route and filter
  messages.

    This change is backwards incompatible and must be enabled with
    the ``fanout_patterns`` transport option:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> conn = kombu.Connection('redis://', transport_options={
        ...     'fanout_patterns': True,
        ... })

    When enabled the exchange will work like an amqp topic exchange
    if the binding key is a pattern.

    This is planned to be default behavior in the future.

- Redis: Fixed ``cycle`` no such attribute error.

.. _version-3.0.12:

3.0.12
======
:release-date: 2014-02-09 03:50 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.3.

- Fixes Python 3.4 logging incompatibility (Issue #311).

- Redis: Now properly handles unknown pub/sub messages.

    Fix contributed by Sam Stavinoha.

- amqplib: Fixed bug where more bytes were requested from the socket
  than necessary.

    Fix contributed by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.

.. _version-3.0.11:

3.0.11
======
:release-date: 2014-02-03 05:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.2.

- Now always trusts messages of type `application/data` and `application/text`
  or which have an unspecified content type (Issue #306).

- Compression errors are now handled as decode errors and will trigger
  the ``Consumer.on_decode_error`` callback if specified.

- New ``kombu.Connection.get_heartbeat_interval()`` method that can be
  used to access the negotiated heartbeat value.

- `kombu.common.oid_for` no longer uses the MAC address of the host, but
   instead uses a process-wide UUID4 as a node id.

    This avoids a call to `uuid.getnode()` at module scope.

- Hub.add: Now normalizes registered fileno.

    Contributed by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.

- SQS: Fixed bug where the prefetch count limit was not respected.

.. _version-3.0.10:

3.0.10
======
:release-date: 2014-01-17 05:40 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.1.

- ``maybe_declare`` now raises a "recoverable connection error" if
  the channel is disconnected instead of a :exc:`ChannelError` so that
  the operation can be retried.

- Redis: ``Consumer.cancel()`` is now thread safe.

    This fixes an issue when using gevent/eventlet and a
    message is handled after the consumer is canceled resulting
    in a "message for queue without consumers" error.

- Retry operations would not always respect the interval_start
  value when calculating the time to sleep for (Issue #303).

    Fix contributed by Antoine Legrand.

- Timer: Fixed "unhashable type" error on Python 3.

- Hub: Do not attempt to unregister operations on an already closed
  poller instance.

.. _version-3.0.9:

3.0.9
=====
:release-date: 2014-01-13 05:30 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` 1.4.0.

- Redis: Basic cancel for fanout based queues now sends a corresponding
  ``UNSUBSCRIBE`` command to the server.

    This fixes an issue with pidbox where reply messages could be received
    after the consumer was canceled, giving the ``"message to queue without
    consumers"`` error.

- MongoDB: Improved connection string and options handling
  (Issue #266 + Issue #120).

    Contributed by Alex Koshelev.

- SQS: Limit the number of messages when receiving in batch to 10.

    This is a hard limit enforced by Amazon so the sqs transport
    must not exceeed this value.

    Fix contributed by Eric Reynolds.

- ConsumerMixin: ``consume`` now checks heartbeat every time the
  socket times out.

    Contributed by Dustin J. Mitchell.

- Retry Policy: A max retries of 0 did not retry forever.

    Fix contributed by Antoine Legrand.

- Simple: If passing a Queue object the simple utils will now take
  default routing key from that queue.

    Contributed by Fernando Jorge Mota.

- ``repr(producer)`` no longer evaluates the underlying channnel.

- Redis: The map of Redis error classes are now exposed at the module level
  using the :func:`kombu.transport.redis.get_redis_error_classes` function.

- Async: ``Hub.close`` now sets ``.poller`` to None.

.. _version-3.0.8:

3.0.8
=====
:release-date: 2013-12-16 05:00 P.M UTC
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Serializer: loads and dumps now wraps exceptions raised into
  :exc:`~kombu.exceptions.DecodeError` and
  :exc:`kombu.exceptions.EncodeError` respectively.

    Contributed by Ionel Cristian Maries

- Redis: Would attempt to read from the wrong connection if a select/epoll/kqueue

- Redis: New option ``fanout_keyprefix``

    This transport option is recommended for all users as it ensures
    that broadcast (fanout) messages sent is only seen by the current
    virtual host:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection('redis://', transport_options={'fanout_keyprefix': True})

    However, enabling this means that you cannot send or receive messages
    from older Kombu versions so make sure all of your participants
    are upgraded and have the transport option enabled.

    This will be the default behavior in Kombu 4.0.

  the consumer without draining events.

.. _version-3.0.0:

3.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2013-10-14 04:00 P.M BST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now depends on :mod:`amqp` version 1.3.

- No longer supports Python 2.5

    The minimum Python version supported is now Python 2.6.0 for Python 2,
    and Python 3.3 for Python 3.

- Dual codebase supporting both Python 2 and 3.

    No longer using ``2to3``, making it easier to maintain support for
    both versions.

- pickle, yaml and msgpack deserialization is now disabled by default.

    This means that Kombu will by default refuse to handle any content type other
    than json.

    Pickle is known to be a security concern as it will happily
    load any object that is embedded in a pickle payload, and payloads
    can be crafted to do almost anything you want.  The default
    serializer in Kombu is json but it also supports a number
    of other serialization formats that it will evaluate if received:
    including pickle.

    It was always assumed that users were educated about the security
    implications of pickle, but in hindsight we don't think users
    should be expected to secure their services if we have the ability to
    be secure by default.

    By disabling any content type that the user did not explicitly
    want enabled we ensure that the user must be conscious when they
    add pickle as a serialization format to support.

    The other built-in serializers (yaml and msgpack) are also disabled
    even though they aren't considered insecure [#f1]_ at this point.
    Instead they're disabled so that if a security flaw is found in one of these
    libraries in the future, you will only be affected if you have
    explicitly enabled them.

    To have your consumer accept formats other than json you have to
    explicitly add the wanted formats to a white-list of accepted
    content types:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> c = Consumer(conn, accept=['json', 'pickle', 'msgpack'])

    or when using synchronous access:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> msg = queue.get(accept=['json', 'pickle', 'msgpack'])

    The ``accept`` argument was first supported for consumers in version
    2.5.10, and first supported by ``Queue.get`` in version 2.5.15
    so to stay compatible with previous versions you can enable
    the previous behavior:

        >>> from kombu import enable_insecure_serializers
        >>> enable_insecure_serializers()

    But note that this has global effect, so be very careful should you use it.

    .. rubric:: Footnotes

    .. [#f1] The PyYAML library has a :func:`yaml.load` function with some of the
             same security implications as pickle, but Kombu uses the
             :func:`yaml.safe_load` function which is not known to be affected.

- kombu.async: Experimental event loop implementation.

    This code was previously in Celery but was moved here
    to make it easier for async transport implementations.

    The API is meant to match the Tulip API which will be included
    in Python 3.4 as the ``asyncio`` module.  It's not a complete
    implementation obviously, but the goal is that it will be easy
    to change to it once that is possible.

- Utility function ``kombu.common.ipublish`` has been removed.

Note about upcoming changes for Kombu 3.0
-----------------------------------------

Kombu 3 consumers will no longer accept pickle/yaml or msgpack
by default, and you will have to explicitly enable untrusted deserializers
either globally using :func:`kombu.enable_insecure_serializers`, or
using the ``accept`` argument to :class:`~kombu.Consumer`.

Changes
-------

- New utility function to disable/enable untrusted serializers.

      - :func:`kombu.disable_insecure_serializers`
      - :func:`kombu.enable_insecure_serializers`.

- Consumer: ``accept`` can now be used to specify a whitelist
  of content types to accept.

    If the accept whitelist is set and a message is received
    with a content type that is not in the whitelist then a
    :exc:`~kombu.exceptions.ContentDisallowed` exception
    is raised.  Note that this error can be handled by the already
    existing `on_decode_error` callback

    Examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        Consumer(accept=['application/json'])
        Consumer(accept=['pickle', 'json'])

- Now depends on amqp 1.0.11

- pidbox: Mailbox now supports the ``accept`` argument.

- Redis: More friendly error for when keys are missing.

- Connection URLs: The parser did not work well when there were
  multiple '+' tokens.

- Pidbox: Now warns if there are multiple nodes consuming from
  the same pidbox.

- Adds :attr:`Queue.on_declared <kombu.Queue.on_declared>`

    A callback to be called when the queue is declared,
    with signature ``(name, messages, consumers)``.

- Now uses fuzzy matching to suggest alternatives to typos in transport
  names.

- SQS: Adds new transport option ``queue_prefix``.

- pyamqp: No longer overrides verify_connection.

- SQS: Now specifies the ``driver_type`` and ``driver_name``

- Redis: Fixed a possible race condition (Issue #171).

- Redis: Ack emulation/visibility_timeout can now be disabled
  using a transport option.

    Ack emulation adds quite a lot of overhead to ensure data is safe
    even in the event of an unclean shutdown.  If data loss do not worry
    you there is now an `ack_emulation` transport option you can use
    to disable it:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection('redis://', transport_options={'ack_emulation': False})

- SQS: Fixed :mod:`boto` v2.7 compatibility (Issue #207).

- Exchange: Should not try to re-declare default exchange (``""``)
  (Issue #209).

- SQS: Long polling is now disabled by default as it was not
  implemented correctly, resulting in long delays between receiving
  messages (Issue #202).

- Fixed Python 2.6 incompatibility depending on ``exc.errno``
  being available.

SQS: Now supports long polling (Issue #176).

    The polling interval default has been changed to 0 and a new
    transport option (``wait_time_seconds``) has been added.
    This parameter specifies how long to wait for a message from
    SQS, and defaults to 20 seconds, which is the maximum
    value currently allowed by Amazon SQS.

- `py-amqp`_ is now the new default transport, replacing ``amqplib``.

    The new `py-amqp`_ library is a fork of amqplib started with the
    following goals:

        - Uses AMQP 0.9.1 instead of 0.8
        - Support for heartbeats (Issue #79 + Issue #131)
        - Automatically revives channels on channel errors.
        - Support for all RabbitMQ extensions
            - Consumer Cancel Notifications (Issue #131)
            - Publisher Confirms (Issue #131).
            - Exchange-to-exchange bindings: ``exchange_bind`` / ``exchange_unbind``.
        - API compatible with :mod:`librabbitmq` so that it can be used
          as a pure-python replacement in environments where rabbitmq-c cannot
          be compiled.  librabbitmq will be updated to support all the same
          features as py-amqp.

- Support for using multiple connection URL's for failover.

    The first argument to :class:`~kombu.Connection` can now be a list of
    connection URLs:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection(['amqp://foo', 'amqp://bar'])

    or it can be a single string argument with several URLs separated by
    semicolon:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection('amqp://foo;amqp://bar')

    There is also a new keyword argument ``failover_strategy`` that defines
    how :meth:`~kombu.Connection.ensure_connection`/
    :meth:`~kombu.Connection.ensure`/:meth:`kombu.Connection.autoretry` will
    reconnect in the event of connection failures.

    The default reconnection strategy is ``round-robin``, which will simply
    cycle through the list forever, and there's also a ``shuffle`` strategy
    that will select random hosts from the list.  Custom strategies can also
    be used, in that case the argument must be a generator yielding the URL
    to connect to.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection('amqp://foo;amqp://bar')

- Now supports PyDev, PyCharm, pylint and other static code analysis tools.

- :class:`~kombu.Queue` now supports multiple bindings.

    You can now have multiple bindings in the same queue by having
    the second argument be a list:

    .. code-block:: python

        from kombu import binding, Queue

        Queue('name', [
            binding(Exchange('E1'), routing_key='foo'),
            binding(Exchange('E1'), routing_key='bar'),
            binding(Exchange('E2'), routing_key='baz'),
        ])

    To enable this, helper methods have been added:

        - :meth:`~kombu.Queue.bind_to`
        - :meth:`~kombu.Queue.unbind_from`

    Contributed by Rumyana Neykova.

- Custom serializers can now be registered using Setuptools entry-points.

    See :ref:`serialization-entrypoints`.

- New :class:`kombu.common.QoS` class used as a thread-safe way to manage
  changes to a consumer or channels prefetch_count.

    This was previously an internal class used in Celery now moved to
    the :mod:`kombu.common` module.

- Consumer now supports a ``on_message`` callback that can be used to process
  raw messages (not decoded).

    Other callbacks specified using the ``callbacks`` argument, and
    the ``receive`` method will be not be called when a on message callback
    is present.

- New utility :func:`kombu.common.ignore_errors` ignores connection and
  channel errors.

    Must only be used for cleanup actions at shutdown or on connection loss.

- Support for exchange-to-exchange bindings.

    The :class:`~kombu.Exchange` entity gained ``bind_to``
    and ``unbind_from`` methods:

    .. code-block:: python

        e1 = Exchange('A')(connection)
        e2 = Exchange('B')(connection)

        e2.bind_to(e1, routing_key='rkey', arguments=None)
        e2.unbind_from(e1, routing_key='rkey', arguments=None)

    This is currently only supported by the ``pyamqp`` transport.

- Redis:  Improved fair queue cycle implementation (Issue #166).

    Contributed by Kevin McCarthy.

- Redis: Unacked message restore limit is now unlimited by default.

    Also, the limit can now be configured using the ``unacked_restore_limit``
    transport option:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection('redis://', transport_options={
            'unacked_restore_limit': 100,
        })

        A limit of 100 means that the consumer will restore at most 100
        messages at each pass.

- Redis: Now uses a mutex to ensure only one consumer restores messages at a
  time.

    The mutex expires after 5 minutes by default, but can be configured
    using the ``unacked_mutex_expire`` transport option.

- LamportClock.adjust now returns the new clock value.

- Heartbeats can now be specified in URLs.

- New ``pyamqp://`` transport!

    The new `py-amqp`_ library is a fork of amqplib started with the
    following goals:

        - Uses AMQP 0.9.1 instead of 0.8
        - Should support all RabbitMQ extensions
        - API compatible with :mod:`librabbitmq` so that it can be used
          as a pure-python replacement in environments where rabbitmq-c cannot
          be compiled.

    .. _`py-amqp`: https://amqp.readthedocs.io/

    If you start using use py-amqp instead of amqplib you can enjoy many
    advantages including:

        - Heartbeat support (Issue #79 + Issue #131)
        - Consumer Cancel Notifications (Issue #131)
        - Publisher Confirms

    amqplib has not been updated in a long while, so maintaining our own fork
    ensures that we can quickly roll out new features and fixes without
    resorting to monkey patching.

    To use the py-amqp transport you must install the :mod:`amqp` library:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install amqp

    and change the connection URL to use the correct transport:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> conn = Connection('pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost//')


    The ``pyamqp://`` transport will be the default fallback transport
    in Kombu version 3.0, when :mod:`librabbitmq` is not installed,
    and librabbitmq will also be updated to support the same features.

- Connection now supports heartbeat argument.

    If enabled you must make sure to manually maintain heartbeats
    by calling the ``Connection.heartbeat_check`` at twice the rate
    of the specified heartbeat interval.

    E.g. if you have ``Connection(heartbeat=10)``,
    then you must call ``Connection.heartbeat_check()`` every 5 seconds.

    if the server has not sent heartbeats at a suitable rate then
    the heartbeat check method must raise an error that is listed
    in ``Connection.connection_errors``.

    The attribute ``Connection.supports_heartbeats`` has been added
    for the ability to inspect if a transport supports heartbeats
    or not.

    Calling ``heartbeat_check`` on a transport that does
    not support heartbeats results in a noop operation.

- SQS: Fixed bug with invalid characters in queue names.

    Fix contributed by Zach Smith.

- utils.reprcall: Fixed typo where kwargs argument was an empty tuple by
  default, and not an empty dict.

- ``BrokerConnection`` now renamed to ``Connection``.

    The name ``Connection`` has been an alias for a very long time,
    but now the rename is official in the documentation as well.

    The Connection alias has been available since version 1.1.3,
    and ``BrokerConnection`` will still work and is not deprecated.

- ``Connection.clone()`` now works for the sqlalchemy transport.

- :func:`kombu.common.eventloop`, :func:`kombu.utils.uuid`,
  and :func:`kombu.utils.url.parse_url` can now be
  imported from the :mod:`kombu` module directly.

- Pidbox transport callback ``after_reply_message_received`` now happens
  in a finally block.

- Trying to use the ``librabbitmq://`` transport will now show the right
  name in the :exc:`ImportError` if :mod:`librabbitmq` is not installed.

    The librabbitmq falls back to the older ``pylibrabbitmq`` name for
    compatibility reasons and would therefore show ``No module named
    pylibrabbitmq`` instead of librabbitmq.

Important Notes
---------------

- The canonical source code repository has been moved to

    http://github.com/celery/kombu

- Pidbox: Exchanges used by pidbox are no longer auto_delete.

    Auto delete has been described as a misfeature,
    and therefore we have disabled it.

    For RabbitMQ users old exchanges used by pidbox must be removed,
    these are named ``mailbox_name.pidbox``,
    and ``reply.mailbox_name.pidbox``.

    The following command can be used to clean up these exchanges:

    .. code-block:: text

        $ VHOST=/ URL=amqp:// python -c'import sys,kombu;[kombu.Connection(
            sys.argv[-1]).channel().exchange_delete(x)
                for x in sys.argv[1:-1]]' \
            $(sudo rabbitmqctl -q list_exchanges -p "$VHOST" \
            | grep \.pidbox | awk '{print $1}') "$URL"

    The :envvar:`VHOST` variable must be set to the target RabbitMQ virtual host,
    and the :envvar:`URL` must be the AMQP URL to the server.

- The ``amqp`` transport alias will now use :mod:`librabbitmq`
  if installed.

    `py-librabbitmq`_ is a fast AMQP client for Python
    using the librabbitmq C library.

    It can be installed by:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install librabbitmq

    It will not be used if the process is monkey patched by eventlet/gevent.

.. _v220-news:

News
----

- Redis: Ack emulation improvements.

    Reducing the possibility of data loss.

    Acks are now implemented by storing a copy of the message when the message
    is consumed.  The copy is not removed until the consumer acknowledges
    or rejects it.

    This means that unacknowledged messages will be redelivered either
    when the connection is closed, or when the visibility timeout is exceeded.

    - Visibility timeout

        This is a timeout for acks, so that if the consumer
        does not ack the message within this time limit, the message
        is redelivered to another consumer.

        The timeout is set to one hour by default, but
        can be changed by configuring a transport option:

            >>> Connection('redis://', transport_options={
            ...     'visibility_timeout': 1800,  # 30 minutes
            ... })

    **NOTE**: Messages that have not been acked will be redelivered
    if the visibility timeout is exceeded, for Celery users
    this means that ETA/countdown tasks that are scheduled to execute
    with a time that exceeds the visibility timeout will be executed
    twice (or more).  If you plan on using long ETA/countdowns you
    should tweak the visibility timeout accordingly:

    .. code-block:: python

        BROKER_TRANSPORT_OPTIONS = {'visibility_timeout': 18000}  # 5 hours

    Setting a long timeout means that it will take a long time
    for messages to be redelivered in the event of a power failure,
    but if so happens you could temporarily set the visibility timeout lower
    to flush out messages when you start up the systems again.

- Experimental `Apache ZooKeeper`_ transport

    More information is in the module reference:
    :mod:`kombu.transport.zookeeper`.

    Contributed by Mahendra M.

.. _`Apache ZooKeeper`: http://zookeeper.apache.org/

- Redis: Priority support.

    The message's ``priority`` field is now respected by the Redis
    transport by having multiple lists for each named queue.
    The queues are then consumed by in order of priority.

    The priority field is a number in the range of 0 - 9, where
    0 is the default and highest priority.

    The priority range is collapsed into four steps by default, since it is
    unlikely that nine steps will yield more benefit than using four steps.
    The number of steps can be configured by setting the ``priority_steps``
    transport option, which must be a list of numbers in **sorted order**:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> x = Connection('redis://', transport_options={
        ...     'priority_steps': [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9],
        ... })

    Priorities implemented in this way is not as reliable as
    priorities on the server side, which is why
    nickname the feature "quasi-priorities";
    **Using routing is still the suggested way of ensuring
    quality of service**, as client implemented priorities
    fall short in a number of ways, e.g. if the worker
    is busy with long running tasks, has prefetched many messages,
    or the queues are congested.

    Still, it is possible that using priorities in combination
    with routing can be more beneficial than using routing
    or priorities alone.  Experimentation and monitoring
    should be used to prove this.

    Contributed by Germán M. Bravo.

- Redis: Now cycles queues so that consuming is fair.

    This ensures that a very busy queue won't block messages
    from other queues, and ensures that all queues have
    an equal chance of being consumed from.

    This used to be the case before, but the behavior was
    accidentally changed while switching to using blocking pop.

- Redis: Auto delete queues that are bound to fanout exchanges
  is now deleted at channel.close.

- amqplib: Refactored the drain_events implementation.

- Pidbox: Now uses ``connection.default_channel``.

- Pickle serialization: Can now decode buffer objects.

- Exchange/Queue declarations can now be cached even if
  the entity is non-durable.

    This is possible because the list of cached declarations
    are now kept with the connection, so that the entities
    will be redeclared if the connection is lost.

- Kombu source code now only uses one-level of explicit relative imports.

Nonblocking consume support
---------------------------

librabbitmq, amqplib and redis transports can now be used
non-blocking.

The interface is very manual, and only consuming messages
is non-blocking so far.

The API should not be regarded as stable or final
in any way. It is used by Celery which has very limited
needs at this point. Hopefully we can introduce a proper
callback-based API later.

- ``Transport.eventmap``

    Is a map of ``fd -> callback(fileno, event)``
    to register in an eventloop.

- ``Transport.on_poll_start()``

    Is called before every call to poll.
    The poller must support ``register(fd, callback)``
    and ``unregister(fd)`` methods.

- ``Transport.on_poll_start(poller)``

    Called when the hub is initialized.
    The poller argument must support the same
    interface as :class:`kombu.utils.eventio.poll`.

- ``Connection.ensure_connection`` now takes a callback
  argument which is called for every loop while
  the connection is down.

- Adds ``connection.drain_nowait``

    This is a non-blocking alternative to drain_events,
    but only supported by amqplib/librabbitmq.

- drain_events now sets ``connection.more_to_read`` if
  there is more data to read.

    This is to support eventloops where other things
    must be handled between draining events.

    can also be set using the ``KOMBU_POLLING_INTERVAL`` setting).

* Adds convenience function: :func:`kombu.common.eventloop`.

Important Notes
---------------

.. _v200-python-compatibility:

Python Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* No longer supports Python 2.4.

    Users of Python 2.4 can still use the 1.x series.

    The 1.x series has entered bugfix-only maintenance mode, and will
    stay that way as long as there is demand, and a willingness to
    maintain it.


.. _v200-new-transports:

New Transports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``django-kombu`` is now part of Kombu core.

    The Django message transport uses the Django ORM to store messages.

    It uses polling, with a default polling interval of 5 seconds.
    The polling interval can be increased or decreased by configuring the
    ``KOMBU_POLLING_INTERVAL`` Django setting, which is the polling
    interval in seconds as an int or a float.  Note that shorter polling
    intervals can cause extreme strain on the database: if responsiveness
    is needed you shall consider switching to a non-polling transport.

    To use it you must use transport alias ``"django"``,
    or as a URL:

    .. code-block:: text

        django://

    and then add ``kombu.transport.django`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and
    run ``manage.py syncdb`` to create the necessary database tables.

    **Upgrading**

    If you have previously used ``django-kombu``, then the entry
    in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` must be changed from ``djkombu``
    to ``kombu.transport.django``:

    .. code-block:: python

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # …,
            'kombu.transport.django',
        )

    If you have previously used django-kombu, then there is no need
    to recreate the tables, as the old tables will be fully compatible
    with the new version.

* ``kombu-sqlalchemy`` is now part of Kombu core.

    This change requires no code changes given that the
    ``sqlalchemy`` transport alias is used.

.. _v200-news:

News
----

* :class:`kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin` is a mixin class that lets you
  easily write consumer programs and threads.

  See :ref:`examples` and :ref:`guide-consumers`.

* SQS Transport: Added support for SQS queue prefixes (Issue #84).

    The queue prefix can be set using the transport option
    ``queue_name_prefix``:

    .. code-block:: python

        BrokerTransport('SQS://', transport_options={
            'queue_name_prefix': 'myapp'})

    Contributed by Nitzan Miron.

* ``Producer.publish`` now supports automatic retry.

    Retry is enabled by the ``reply`` argument, and retry options
    set by the ``retry_policy`` argument:

    .. code-block:: python

        exchange = Exchange('foo')
        producer.publish(message, exchange=exchange, retry=True,
                         declare=[exchange], retry_policy={
                            'interval_start': 1.0})

    See :meth:`~kombu.Connection.ensure`
    for a list of supported retry policy options.

* ``Producer.publish`` now supports a ``declare`` keyword argument.

    This is a list of entities (:class:`Exchange`, or :class:`Queue`)
    that should be declared before the message is published.

.. _v200-fixes:

* Redis transport: Timeout was multiplied by 1000 seconds when using
  ``select`` for event I/O (Issue #86).

.. _version-1.5.1:

1.5.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-11-30 01:00 P.M GMT
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Fixes issue with ``kombu.compat`` introduced in 1.5.0 (Issue #83).

* Adds the ability to disable content_types in the serializer registry.

    Any message with a content type that is disabled will be refused.
    One example would be to disable the Pickle serializer:

        >>> from kombu.serialization import registry
        # by name
        >>> registry.disable('pickle')
        # or by mime-type.
        >>> registry.disable('application/x-python-serialize')

:release-date: 2011-11-27 06:00 P.M GMT
:release-by: Ask Solem

* kombu.pools: Fixed a bug resulting in resources not being properly released.

  This was caused by the use of ``__hash__`` to distinguish them.

* Virtual transports: Dead-letter queue is now disabled by default.

    The dead-letter queue was enabled by default to help application
    authors, but now that Kombu is stable it should be removed.
    There are after all many cases where messages should just be dropped
    when there are no queues to buffer them, and keeping them without
    supporting automatic cleanup is rather considered a resource leak
    than a feature.

    If wanted the dead-letter queue can still be enabled, by using
    the ``deadletter_queue`` transport option:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> x = Connection('redis://',
        ...       transport_options={'deadletter_queue': 'ae.undeliver'})

    In addition, an :class:`UndeliverableWarning` is now emitted when
    the dead-letter queue is enabled and a message ends up there.

    Contributed by Ionel Maries Cristian.

* MongoDB transport now supports Replicasets (Issue #81).

    Contributed by Ivan Metzlar.

* The ``Connection.ensure`` methods now accepts a ``max_retries`` value
  of 0.

    A value of 0 now means *do not retry*, which is distinct from :const:`None`
    which means *retry indefinitely*.

    Contributed by Dan McGee.

* SQS Transport: Now has a lowercase ``sqs`` alias, so that it can be
  used with broker URLs (Issue #82).

    Fix contributed by Hong Minhee

* SQS Transport: Fixes KeyError on message acknowledgments (Issue #73).

    The SQS transport now uses UUID's for delivery tags, rather than
    a counter.

    Fix contributed by Brian Bernstein.

* SQS Transport: Unicode related fixes (Issue #82).

    Fix contributed by Hong Minhee.

* Redis version check could crash because of improper handling of types
  (Issue #63).

* Fixed error with `Resource.force_close_all` when resources
  were not yet properly initialized (Issue #78).

.. _version-1.4.0:

1.4.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-09-22 05:00 P.M BST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Adds module :mod:`kombu.mixins`.

    This module contains a :class:`~kombu.mixins.ConsumerMixin` class
    that can be used to easily implement a message consumer
    thread that consumes messages from one or more
    :class:`kombu.Consumer` instances.

* New example: :ref:`task-queue-example`

    Using the ``ConsumerMixin``, default channels and
    the global connection pool to demonstrate new Kombu features.

* MongoDB transport did not work with MongoDB >= 2.0 (Issue #66)

    Fix contributed by James Turk.

* Redis-py version check did not account for beta identifiers
  in version string.

    Fix contributed by David Ziegler.

* Producer and Consumer now accepts a connection instance as the
  first argument.

    The connections default channel will then be used.

    In addition shortcut methods has been added to Connection:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> connection.Producer(exchange)
        >>> connection.Consumer(queues=..., callbacks=...)

* Connection has aquired a ``connected`` attribute that
  can be used to check if the connection instance has established
  a connection.

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire_channel`` now returns the connections
  default channel rather than establising a new channel that
  must be manually handled.

* Added ``kombu.common.maybe_declare``

    ``maybe_declare(entity)`` declares an entity if it has
    not previously been declared in the same process.

* :func:`kombu.compat.entry_to_queue` has been moved to :mod:`kombu.common`

* New module :mod:`kombu.clocks` now contains an implementation
  of Lamports logical clock.

* Connection.default_channel is now closed when connection is revived
  after connection failures.

* Pika: Channel now supports the ``connection.client`` attribute
  as required by the simple interface.

* pools.set_limit now raises an exception if the limit is lower
  than the previous limit.

* pools.set_limit no longer resets the pools.

.. _version-1.3.1:

1.3.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-07 03:00 P.M BST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Last release broke after fork for pool reinitialization.

* Producer/Consumer now has a ``connection`` attribute,
  giving access to the :class:`Connection` of the
  instance.

* Pika: Channels now have access to the underlying
  :class:`Connection` instance using ``channel.connection.client``.

    This was previously required by the ``Simple`` classes and is now
    also required by :class:`Consumer` and :class:`Producer`.

* Connection.default_channel is now closed at object revival.

* Adds kombu.clocks.LamportClock.

* compat.entry_to_queue has been moved to new module :mod:`kombu.common`.

.. _version-1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2011-10-05 01:00 P.M BST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Broker connection info can be now be specified using URLs

    The broker hostname can now be given as a URL instead, of the format:

    .. code-block:: text

        transport://user:password@hostname:port/virtual_host

    for example the default broker is expressed as:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> Connection('amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//')

    Transport defaults to amqp, and is not required.
    user, password, port and virtual_host is also not mandatory and
    will default to the corresponding transports default.

    .. note::

        Note that the path component (virtual_host) always starts with a
        forward-slash.  This is necessary to distinguish between the virtual
        host '' (empty) and '/', which are both acceptable virtual host names.

        A virtual host of '/' becomes::

        .. code-block:: text

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

        and a virtual host of '' (empty) becomes:

        .. code-block:: text

            amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/

        So the leading slash in the path component is **always required**.

* Now comes with default global connection and producer pools.

    The acquire a connection using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`Connection`:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from kombu import Connection, connections
        >>> connection = Connection('amqp://guest:guest@localhost//')
        >>> with connections[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     # do something with connection

    To acquire a producer using the connection parameters
    from a :class:`Connection`:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from kombu import Connection, producers
        >>> connection = Connection('amqp://guest:guest@localhost//')
        >>> with producers[connection].acquire(block=True):
        ...     producer.publish({'hello': 'world'}, exchange='hello')

    Acquiring a producer will in turn also acquire a connection
    from the associated pool in ``connections``, so you the number
    of producers is bound the same limit as number of connections.

    The default limit of 100 connections per connection instance
    can be changed by doing:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pools.set_limit(10)

    The pool can also be forcefully closed by doing:

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from kombu import pools
        >>> pool.reset()

* SQS Transport: Persistence using SimpleDB is now disabled by default,
  after reports of unstable SimpleDB connections leading to errors.

* :class:`Producer` can now be used as a context manager.

* ``Producer.__exit__`` now properly calls ``release`` instead of close.

    The previous behavior would lead to a memory leak when using
    the :class:`kombu.pools.ProducerPool`

* Now silences all exceptions from `import ctypes` to match behaviour
  of the standard Python uuid module, and avoid passing on MemoryError
  exceptions on SELinux-enabled systems (Issue #52 + Issue #53)

* ``amqp`` is now an alias to the ``amqplib`` transport.

* ``kombu.syn.detect_environment`` now returns 'default', 'eventlet', or
  'gevent' depending on what monkey patches have been installed.

* Serialization registry has new attribute ``type_to_name`` so it is
  possible to lookup serializater name by content type.

* Exchange argument to ``Producer.publish`` can now be an :class:`Exchange`
  instance.

* ``compat.Publisher`` now supports the ``channel`` keyword argument.

* Acking a message on some transports could lead to :exc:`KeyError` being
  raised (Issue #57).

* Connection pool:  Connections are no long instantiated when the pool is
  created, but instantiated as needed instead.

* Tests now pass on PyPy.

* ``Connection.as_uri`` now includes the password if the keyword argument
  ``include_password`` is set.

* Virtual transports now comes with a default ``default_connection_params``
  attribute.

.. _version-1.2.1:

* Now depends on amqplib >= 1.0.0.

* Redis: Now automatically deletes auto_delete queues at ``basic_cancel``.

* ``serialization.unregister`` added so it is possible to remove unwanted
  seralizers.

* Fixes MemoryError while importing ctypes on SELinux (Issue #52).

* ``Connection.autoretry`` is a version of ``ensure`` that works
  with arbitrary functions (i.e. it does not need an associated object
  that implements the ``revive`` method.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: python

        channel = connection.channel()
        try:
            ret, channel = connection.autoretry(send_messages, channel=channel)
        finally:
            channel.close()

* ``ConnectionPool.acquire`` no longer force establishes the connection.

    The connection will be established as needed.

* ``Connection.ensure`` now supports an ``on_revive`` callback
  that is applied whenever the connection is re-established.

* ``Consumer.consuming_from(queue)`` returns True if the Consumer is
  consuming from ``queue``.

* ``Consumer.cancel_by_queue`` did not remove the queue from ``queues``.

* ``compat.ConsumerSet.add_queue_from_dict`` now automatically declared
  the queue if ``auto_declare`` set.

  arguments (Issue #48).

* Adds Queue.no_ack option to control the no_ack option for individual queues.

* Recent versions broke pylibrabbitmq support.

* SimpleQueue and SimpleBuffer can now be used as contexts.

* Test requirements specifies PyYAML==3.09 as 3.10 dropped Python 2.4 support

* Redis: Fixes issue introduced in 1.1.4, where a redis connection
  failure could leave consumer hanging forever.

* SQS: Now supports fanout messaging by using SimpleDB to store routing
  tables.

    This can be disabled by setting the `supports_fanout` transport option:

        >>> Connection(transport='SQS',
        ...            transport_options={'supports_fanout': False})

* SQS: Now properly deletes a message when a message is acked.

* SQS: Can now set the Amazon AWS region, by using the ``region``
  transport option.

* amqplib: Now uses `localhost` as default hostname instead of raising an
  error.

* Redis: Consuming from multiple connections now works with Eventlet.

* Redis: Can now perform channel operations while the channel is in
  BRPOP/LISTEN mode (Issue #35).

    Also the async BRPOP now times out after 1 second, this means that
    canceling consuming from a queue/starting consuming from additional queues
    has a latency of up to one second (BRPOP does not support subsecond
    timeouts).

* Virtual: Allow channel objects to be closed multiple times without error.

* amqplib: ``AttributeError`` has been added to the list of known
  connection related errors (:attr:`Connection.connection_errors`).

* amqplib: Now converts :exc:`SSLError` timeout errors to

Important Notes
---------------

* Virtual transports: Message body is now base64 encoded by default
  (Issue #27).

    This should solve problems sending binary data with virtual
    transports.

    Message compatibility is handled by adding a ``body_encoding``
    property, so messages sent by older versions is compatible
    with this release.  However -- If you are accessing the messages
    directly not using Kombu, then you have to respect
    the ``body_encoding`` property.

    If you need to disable base64 encoding then you can do so
    via the transport options:

    .. code-block:: python

        Connection(transport='...',
                   transport_options={'body_encoding': None})

    **For transport authors**:

        You don't have to change anything in your custom transports,
        as this is handled automatically by the base class.

        If you want to use a different encoder you can do so by adding
        a key to ``Channel.codecs``.  Default encoding is specified
        by the ``Channel.body_encoding`` attribute.

        A new codec must provide two methods: ``encode(data)`` and
        ``decode(data)``.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Setting ``limit=None`` (or 0)
  now disables pool semantics, and will establish and close
  the resource whenever acquired or released.

* ConnectionPool/ChannelPool/Resource: Is now using a LIFO queue
  instead of the previous FIFO behavior.

    This means that the last resource released will be the one
    acquired next.  I.e. if only a single thread is using the pool
    this means only a single connection will ever be used.

* Connection: Cloned connections did not inherit transport_options
  (``__copy__``).

* contrib/requirements is now located in the top directory
  of the distribution.

* MongoDB: Now supports authentication using the ``userid`` and ``password``
  arguments to :class:`Connection` (Issue #30).

* Connection: Default autentication credentials are now delegated to
  the individual transports.

    This means that the ``userid`` and ``password`` arguments to
    Connection is no longer *guest/guest* by default.

    The amqplib and pika transports will still have the default
    credentials.

* :meth:`Consumer.__exit__` did not have the correct signature (Issue #32).

* Channel objects now have a ``channel_id`` attribute.

* MongoDB: Version sniffing broke with development versions of
    mongod (Issue #29).

* New environment variable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION` will now emit debug
    log messages for connection related actions.

  :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` will also enable :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CONNECTION`.

.. _version-1.0.7:

1.0.7
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-28 05:45 P.M CEST
:release-by: Ask Solem

* Now depends on anyjson 0.3.1

    cjson is no longer a recommended json implementation, and anyjson
    will now emit a deprecation warning if used.

* Please note that the Pika backend only works with version 0.5.2.

    The latest version (0.9.x) drastically changed API, and it is not
    compatible yet.

* on_decode_error is now called for exceptions in message_to_python
  (Issue #24).

* Redis: did not respect QoS settings.

* Redis: Creating a connection now ensures the connection is established.

    This means ``Connection.ensure_connection`` works properly with
    Redis.

* consumer_tag argument to ``Queue.consume`` can't be :const:`None`
  (Issue #21).

    A None value is now automatically converted to empty string.
    An empty string will make the server generate a unique tag.

* Connection now supports a ``transport_options`` argument.

    This can be used to pass additional arguments to transports.

* Pika: ``drain_events`` raised :exc:`socket.timeout` even if no timeout
  set (Issue #8).

.. version-1.0.6:

1.0.6

:release-date: 2011-03-22 04:00 P.M CET
:release-by: Ask Solem

* The ``delivery_mode`` aliases (persistent/transient) were not automatically
  converted to integer, and would cause a crash if using the amqplib
  transport.

* Redis: The redis-py :exc:`InvalidData` exception suddenly changed name to
  :exc:`DataError`.

* The :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` environment variable can now be set to log all
  channel method calls.

  Support for the following environment variables have been added:

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CHANNEL` will wrap channels in an object that
      logs every method call.

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` both enables channel logging and configures the
      root logger to emit messages to standard error.

    **Example Usage**:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG=1 python
        >>> from kombu import Connection
        >>> conn = Connection()
        >>> channel = conn.channel()
        Start from server, version: 8.0, properties:
            {u'product': 'RabbitMQ',..............  }
        Open OK! known_hosts []
        using channel_id: 1
        Channel open
        >>> channel.queue_declare('myq', passive=True)
        [Kombu channel:1] queue_declare('myq', passive=True)
        (u'myq', 0, 1)

* Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels.  All virtual transports
  affected (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy, couchdb, beanstalk).

* Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking messages.

    If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself as an
    exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation. (``object no longer
    exists``).

* MongoDB transport requires the ``findandmodify`` command only available in
  MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if connected to an incompatible
  server version.

* Virtual Transports: ``basic.cancel`` should not try to remove unknown
  consumer tag.
